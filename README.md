This example demonstrates a common Swift compiler error related to missing arguments in function calls. The `calculateArea` function requires both `width` and `height` parameters with their labels.  The incorrect call omits the label for `height`, resulting in a compiler error. The solution shows the correct usage of the function with proper parameter labels. This is a crucial concept for understanding Swift's function call syntax.
